    <h2>Made a Great Dinner with Beef Shatkora! </h2>
    <p>
        This Bangladeshi beef shatkora recipe is a dish of contrasts. <br>
        Rich spiced beef is balanced with the sour bitter flavour of the shatkora, a type of citrus fruit grown in the country. <br>
        A stunning curry typically eaten during autumn. <br>
        If you can't find shatkora (sold fresh and frozen in Bangladeshi grocery shops), <br>
        it can be replaced with the same amount of grapefruit or pomelo. <br>
    </p>

    <h1><b>Method</b></h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the piece of shatkora into wedges and then chop each wedge <br> into 4 pieces, 
                making sure to remove any seeds. <br> If using frozen shatkora, defrost first in cold water for 1 hour, <br>
                 then cut each slice into 4 pieces and set aside </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat and add the garlic, ginger and onions. <br>
                 Saut√© for a few minutes until the onions are translucent</li>
            <li>Stir in the beef, salt, whole spices and green chillies and add 250ml of cold water. <br> 
                Bring to a simmer then cover and cook for 40 minutes over a medium heat, stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>After 40 minutes add the ground spices, stirring so they cover <br> the pieces of beef, then cover and cook for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the shatkora and 250ml of hot water. <br> Stir once then cover and cook for 10 minutes on a low heat</li>
            <li>Top up the pan with 400ml of hot water and bring to the boil over <br> a high heat (do not stir). Simmer 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the chopped coriander, cover and cook on low heat for 10 more minutes, or until the meat is tender</li>
            <li>Serve with sticky white rice and a side salad of cucumber, red onion and tomatoes. <br> Garnish with fresh coriander if you wish</li>
        </ol>
