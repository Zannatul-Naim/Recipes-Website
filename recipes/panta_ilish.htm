    <p>
        Panta ilish is a dish from Bangladesh that combines a bowl of panta bhat—cooked and soaked rice—with fried ilish fish. <br>
        The combination is traditionally enjoyed in urban areas,  and it has become a staple dish served on the Pahela Baishakh, <br>
        a national holiday celebrating the first day of the Bengali calendar. <br> <br>
        The fish is usually generously seasoned with turmeric, chili powder or other spices, and the dish is typically topped <br>
         with fresh chili peppers, onions, and bhorta—traditional vegetable or fish mash that is usually served as a side dish. <br>
